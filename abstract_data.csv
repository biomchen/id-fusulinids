in-utero volumetric MRI time series. Spatio-temporal analysis of dynamic MRI
requires robust alignment across time in the presence of substantial and
unpredictable motion. We make a Markov assumption on the nature of deformations
to take advantage of the temporal structure in the image data. Forward message
passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation
algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between
consecutive frames. We demonstrate the utility of the temporal model by showing
that its use improves the accuracy of the segmentation propagation through
temporal registration. Our results suggest that the proposed model captures
accurately the temporal dynamics of deformations in in-utero MRI time series."
Elfar Adalsteinsson,arXiv:0907.2083,https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2083,"Abstract:  A linear inverse problem is proposed that requires the determination of
multiple unknown signal vectors. Each unknown vector passes through a different
system matrix and the results are added to yield a single observation vector.
Given the matrices and lone observation, the objective is to find a
simultaneously sparse set of unknown vectors that solves the system. We will
refer to this as the multiple-system single-output (MSSO) simultaneous sparsity
problem. This manuscript contrasts the MSSO problem with other simultaneous
sparsity problems and conducts a thorough initial exploration of algorithms
with which to solve it. Seven algorithms are formulated that approximately
solve this NP-Hard problem. Three greedy techniques are developed (matching
pursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and least squares matching pursuit) along
with four methods based on a convex relaxation (iteratively reweighted least
squares, two forms of iterative shrinkage, and formulation as a second-order
cone program). The algorithms are evaluated across three experiments: the first
and second involve sparsity profile recovery in noiseless and noisy scenarios,
respectively, while the third deals with magnetic resonance imaging
radio-frequency excitation pulse design."

dense layered objects, with range of projection angles limited to $\pm
$10$^\circ$. Whereas previous approaches to phase tomography generally require
two steps, first to retrieve phase projections from intensity projections and
then perform tomographic reconstruction on the retrieved phase projections, in
our work a physics-informed pre-processor followed by a Deep Neural Network
(DNN) conduct the three-dimensional reconstruction directly from the intensity
projections. We demonstrate this single-step method experimentally in the
visible optical domain on a scaled up integrated circuit phantom. We show that
even under conditions of highly attenuated photon fluxes a DNN trained only on
synthetic data can be used to successfully reconstruct physical samples
disjoint from the synthetic training set. Thus, the need of producing a large
number of physical examples for training is ameliorated. The method is
generally applicable to tomography with electromagnetic or other types of
radiation at all bands."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1810.01963,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01963,"Abstract:  Efficiently scheduling data processing jobs on distributed compute clusters
requires complex algorithms. Current systems, however, use simple generalized
heuristics and ignore workload structure, since developing and tuning a bespoke
heuristic for each workload is infeasible. In this paper, we show that modern
machine learning techniques can generate highly-efficient policies
automatically.
Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn
workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond
specifying a high-level objective such as minimizing average job completion
time. Off-the-shelf RL techniques, however, cannot handle the complexity and
scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new
representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and
invent new RL training methods for continuous job arrivals.
Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima
outperforms several heuristics, including hand-tuned ones, by at least 21%.
Further experiments with an industrial production workload trace demonstrate
that Decima delivers up to a 17% reduction in average job completion time and
scales to large clusters."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1809.05088,https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05088,"Abstract:  With the growing usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, many
scalability challenges have emerged. A promising scaling solution, exemplified
by the Lightning Network, uses a network of bidirectional payment channels that
allows fast transactions between two parties. However, routing payments on
these networks efficiently is non-trivial, since payments require finding paths
with sufficient funds, and channels can become unidirectional over time
blocking further transactions through them. Today's payment channel networks
exacerbate these problems by attempting to deliver all payments atomically. In
this paper, we present the Spider network, a new packet-switched architecture
for payment channel networks. Spider splits payments into transaction units and
transmits them over time across different paths. Spider uses congestion
control, payment scheduling, and imbalance-aware routing to optimize delivery
of payments. Our results show that Spider improves the volume and number of
successful payments on the network by 10-45% and 5-40% respectively compared to
state-of-the-art approaches."

content providers. Yet, such methods have not become widespread except for a
few niche instances. An important challenge is incentivization: what tangible
benefits does P2P content delivery offer users who bring resources to the
table? In this paper, we ask whether monetary incentives can help attract peers
in P2P content delivery systems. We commissioned a professional survey of
people around theUnited States to answer several relevant questions. We found
that 51% of the 876 respondents--substantially larger than our

financial incentives. Encouraged by the results of the survey, we propose
Gringotts, a system to structure incentives and securely incorporate P2P

Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1807.02264,https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02264,"Abstract:  We consider reinforcement learning in input-driven environments, where an
exogenous, stochastic input process affects the dynamics of the system. Input
processes arise in many applications, including queuing systems, robotics
control with disturbances, and object tracking. Since the state dynamics and
rewards depend on the input process, the state alone provides limited
information for the expected future returns. Therefore, policy gradient methods
with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training.
We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and
analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose
a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that
depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across
environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic
locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability
and result in better eventual policies."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1803.09615,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09615,"Abstract:  Homa is a new transport protocol for datacenter networks. It provides
exceptionally low latency, especially for workloads with a high volume of very
short messages, and it also supports large messages and high network
utilization. Homa uses in-network priority queues to ensure low latency for
short messages; priority allocation is managed dynamically by each receiver and
integrated with a receiver-driven flow control mechanism. Homa also uses
controlled overcommitment of receiver downlinks to ensure efficient bandwidth
utilization at high load. Our implementation of Homa delivers 99th percentile
round-trip times less than 15{\mu}s for short messages on a 10 Gbps network
running at 80% load. These latencies are almost 100x lower than the best
published measurements of an implementation. In simulations, Homa's latency is
roughly equal to pFabric and significantly better than pHost, PIAS, and NDP for
almost all message sizes and workloads. Homa can also sustain higher network
loads than pFabric, pHost, or PIAS."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1802.08730,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08730,"Abstract:  This paper develops a technique to detect whether the cross traffic competing
with a flow is elastic or not, and shows how to use the elasticity detector to
improve congestion control. If the cross traffic is elastic, i.e., made up of
flows like Cubic or NewReno that increase their rate when they perceive
available bandwidth, then one should use a scheme that competes well with such
traffic. Such a scheme will not be able to control delays because the cross
traffic will not cooperate to maintain low delays. If, however, cross traffic
is inelastic, then one can use a suitable delay-controlled algorithm. Our
elasticity detector uses an asymmetric sinusoidal pulse pattern and estimates
elasticity by computing the frequency response (FFT) of the cross traffic
estimate; we have measured its accuracy to be over 90%. We present the design
and evaluation of Nimbus, a congestion control protocol that uses the
elasticity detector to switch between delay-control and TCP-competitive modes.
Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that Nimbus achieves
throughput comparable to or better than Cubic always, but with delays that are
much lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Unlike BBR, Nimbus is fair to
Cubic, and has significantly lower delay by 40-50 ms. Compared to Copa, which
also switches between a delay-controlling and a TCP-competitive mode, Nimbus is
more robust at correctly detecting the nature of cross traffic, and unlike
Copa, it is usable by a variety of delay-based and TCP-competitive methods."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1802.04948,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04948,"Abstract:  Neural networks have been shown to be an effective tool for learning
algorithms over graph-structured data. However, graph representation
techniques---that convert graphs to real-valued vectors for use with neural

approaches (e.g., graph convolutional networks), but these methods have
difficulty scaling and generalizing to graphs with different sizes and shapes.
We present Graph2Seq, a new technique that represents vertices of graphs as
infinite time-series. By not limiting the representation to a fixed dimension,
Graph2Seq scales naturally to graphs of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Graph2Seq
is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the

High-resolution aerial imagery provides a promising avenue to automatically
infer a road network. Prior work uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
detect which pixels belong to a road (segmentation), and then uses complex
post-processing heuristics to infer graph connectivity. We show that these
segmentation methods have high error rates because noisy CNN outputs are
difficult to correct. We propose RoadTracer, a new method to automatically
construct accurate road network maps from aerial images. RoadTracer uses an
iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive the

RoadTracer correctly captures 45% more junctions across these cities."

Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1702.02588,https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02588,"Abstract:  As its price per bit drops, SSD is increasingly becoming the default storage
medium for cloud application databases. However, it has not become the
preferred storage medium for key-value caches, even though SSD offers more than
10x lower price per bit and sufficient performance compared to DRAM. This is
because key-value caches need to frequently insert, update and evict small
objects. This causes excessive writes and erasures on flash storage, since
flash only supports writes and erasures of large chunks of data. These
excessive writes and erasures significantly shorten the lifetime of flash,
rendering it impractical to use for key-value caches. We present Flashield, a
hybrid key-value cache that uses DRAM as a ""filter"" to minimize writes to SSD.
Flashield performs light-weight machine learning profiling to predict which
objects are likely to be read frequently before getting updated; these objects,
which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large
chunks sequentially. In order to efficiently utilize the cache's available
memory, we design a novel in-memory index for the variable-sized objects stored
on flash that requires only 4 bytes per object in DRAM. We describe Flashield's
design and implementation and, we evaluate it on a real-world cache trace.
Compared to state-of-the-art systems that suffer a write amplification of 2.5x
or more, Flashield maintains a median write amplification of 0.5x without any
loss of hit rate or throughput."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1602.06045,https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06045,"Abstract:  Switches today provide a small set of scheduling algorithms. While we can
tweak scheduling parameters, we cannot modify algorithmic logic, or add a
completely new algorithm, after the switch has been designed. This paper
presents a design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling
algorithms---potentially algorithms that are unknown today---to be programmed
into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.
Our design builds on the observation that scheduling algorithms make two
decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them.
Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets
are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler
using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority
queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.
We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide
variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a detailed hardware design for
this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch with <4% chip area
overhead on a 16-nm standard-cell library. Our design lets us program many
sophisticated algorithms, such as a 5-level hierarchical scheduler with
programmable scheduling algorithms at each level."
Mohammad Alizadeh,arXiv:1512.05023,https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05023,"Abstract:  Many algorithms for congestion control, scheduling, network measurement,
active queue management, security, and load balancing require custom processing
of packets as they traverse the data plane of a network switch. To run at line
rate, these data-plane algorithms must be in hardware. With today's switch
hardware, algorithms cannot be changed, nor new algorithms installed, after a
switch has been built.
This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level
language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run on
emerging programmable line-rate switching chipsets. The key challenge is that
these algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. The key idea to achieve
line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms is the notion of a packet
transaction : a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated from other
such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative
language to express data-plane algorithms. We show with many examples that
Domino provides a convenient and natural way to express sophisticated
data-plane algorithms, and show that these algorithms can be run at line rate
with modest estimated die-area overhead."

wireless) is used in conjunction with a low bandwidth packet switch - is a
promising alternative to interconnect servers in today's large scale
data-centers. Circuit switches offer a very high link rate, but incur a
non-trivial reconfiguration delay which makes their scheduling challenging. In
this paper, we demonstrate a lightweight, simple and nearly-optimal scheduling
algorithm that trades-off configuration costs with the benefits of
reconfiguration that match the traffic demands. The algorithm has strong
connections to submodular optimization, has performance at least half that of
the optimal schedule and strictly outperforms state of the art in a variety of
traffic demand settings. These ideas naturally generalize: we see that indirect
routing leads to exponential connectivity; this is another phenomenon of the
power of multi hop routing, distinct from the well-known load balancing

into network behavior, enabling them to work with the network to achieve a
common goal. Our design leverages what each component does best: (a) switches
forward and execute tiny packet programs (at most 5 instructions) at line rate,
and (b) end-hosts perform arbitrary computation on network state, which are
easy to evolve. Using a hardware prototype on a NetFPGA, we show our design is

(SIMD) or vector instructions which expose data level parallelism at a fine
granularity. Programmers exploit this parallelism by using low-level vector
intrinsics in their code. However, once programs are written using vector
intrinsics of a specific instruction set, the code becomes non-portable. Modern
compilers are unable to analyze and retarget the code to newer vector
instruction sets. Hence, programmers have to manually rewrite the same code
using vector intrinsics of a newer generation to exploit higher data widths and
capabilities of new instruction sets. This process is tedious, error-prone and
requires maintaining multiple code bases. We propose Revec, a compiler
optimization pass which revectorizes already vectorized code, by retargeting it
to use vector instructions of newer generations. The transformation is
transparent, happening at the compiler intermediate representation level, and
enables performance portability of hand-vectorized code.
Revec can achieve performance improvements in real-world performance critical
kernels. In particular, Revec achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.160$\times$

1.145$\times$ and 1.195$\times$ on hand-vectorized x265 media codec kernels

model modern processors with incomplete specifications. This is tedious, error
prone and should be done for each processor generation. We present Ithemal, the
first automatically learnt estimator to statically predict throughput of a set

This paper introduces GraphIt, a new DSL for graph computations that

separates what is computed (algorithm) from how it is computed (schedule).
Programmers specify the algorithm using an algorithm language, and performance
optimizations are specified using a scheduling language. The algorithm language
simplifies expressing the algorithms. We formulate graph optimizations,

work-efficiency. The scheduling language enables programmers to easily search
through this complicated tradeoff space by composing together optimizations. We
also built an autotuner to automatically find high-performance schedules. The
compiler uses a new scheduling representation, the graph iteration space, to
model, compose, and ensure the validity of the large number of optimizations.
GraphIt outperforms the next fastest of six state-of-the-art shared-memory

Saman Amarasinghe,arXiv:1608.01362,https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01362,"Abstract:  Modern hardware systems are heavily underutilized when running large-scale
graph applications. While many in-memory graph frameworks have made substantial
progress in optimizing these applications, we show that it is still possible to
achieve up to 4 $\times$ speedups over the fastest frameworks by greatly
improving cache utilization. Previous systems have applied out-of-core
processing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary.
However, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because
of the much smaller performance gap between DRAM and cache. We present two
techniques that take advantage of the cache with minimal or no instruction
overhead. The first, frequency based clustering, groups together frequently
accessed vertices to improve the utilization of each cache line with no runtime
overhead. The second, CSR segmenting, partitions the graph to restrict all
random accesses to the cache, makes all DRAM access sequential, and merges
partition results using a very low overhead cache-aware merge. Both techniques
can be easily implemented on top of optimized graph frameworks. Our techniques
combined give speedups of up to 4 $\times$ for PageRank, Label Propagation and
Collaborative Filtering, and 2 $\times$ for Betweenness Centrality over the
best published results"

show that the TAT, together with band edge non-abruptness known as the Urbach
tail, sets the lower limit of the sub-threshold swing and the minimum
achievable current at a given temperature. Presence of charged trap states also
contributes to reduced gate efficiency. We show that we can decouple the
contribution of each of these processes and extract the intrinsic sub-threshold
swing from a given experimental data. We derive closed form expressions of

accurately capture the essential device physics of TFETs. We test the model

Dimitri Antoniadis,arXiv:1603.06654,https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06654,"Abstract:  We provide a detailed study of the interface Trap Assisted Tunneling (TAT)
mechanism in tunnel field effect transistors to show how it contributes a major
leakage current path before the Band To Band Tunneling (BTBT) is initiated.
With a modified Shockley-Read-Hall formalism, we show that at room temperature,
the phonon assisted TAT current always dominates and obscures the steep turn ON
of the BTBT current for common densities of traps. Our results are applicable
to top gate, double gate and gate all around structures where the traps are
positioned between the source-channel tunneling region. Since the TAT has
strong dependence on electric field, any effort to increase the BTBT current by
enhancing local electric field also increases the leakage current. Unless the
BTBT current can be increased separately, calculations show that the trap
density Dit has to be decreased by 40-100 times compared with the state of the
art in order for the steep turn ON (for III-V materials) to be clearly
observable at room temperature. We find that the combination of the intrinsic
sharpness of the band edges (Urbach tail) and the surface trap density
determines the subthreshold swing."

with a flow is elastic or not, and shows how to use the elasticity detector to
improve congestion control. If the cross traffic is elastic, i.e., made up of
flows like Cubic or NewReno that increase their rate when they perceive
available bandwidth, then one should use a scheme that competes well with such
traffic. Such a scheme will not be able to control delays because the cross
traffic will not cooperate to maintain low delays. If, however, cross traffic
is inelastic, then one can use a suitable delay-controlled algorithm. Our
elasticity detector uses an asymmetric sinusoidal pulse pattern and estimates
elasticity by computing the frequency response (FFT) of the cross traffic
estimate; we have measured its accuracy to be over 90%. We present the design
and evaluation of Nimbus, a congestion control protocol that uses the
elasticity detector to switch between delay-control and TCP-competitive modes.
Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that Nimbus achieves
throughput comparable to or better than Cubic always, but with delays that are
much lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Unlike BBR, Nimbus is fair to
Cubic, and has significantly lower delay by 40-50 ms. Compared to Copa, which
also switches between a delay-controlling and a TCP-competitive mode, Nimbus is
more robust at correctly detecting the nature of cross traffic, and unlike

into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.
Our design builds on the observation that scheduling algorithms make two
decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them.
Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets
are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler
using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority
queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.
We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide

Regina Barzilay,arXiv:1401.3457,https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3457,"Abstract:  This paper presents a new method for inferring the semantic properties of
documents by leveraging free-text keyphrase annotations. Such annotations are
becoming increasingly abundant due to the recent dramatic growth in
semi-structured, user-generated online content. One especially relevant domain
is product reviews, which are often annotated by their authors with pros/cons
keyphrases such as a real bargain or good value. These annotations are
representative of the underlying semantic properties; however, unlike expert
annotations, they are noisy: lay authors may use different labels to denote the
same property, and some labels may be missing. To learn using such noisy
annotations, we find a hidden paraphrase structure which clusters the
keyphrases. The paraphrase structure is linked with a latent topic model of the
review texts, enabling the system to predict the properties of unannotated
documents and to effectively aggregate the semantic properties of multiple
reviews. Our approach is implemented as a hierarchical Bayesian model with
joint inference. We find that joint inference increases the robustness of the
keyphrase clustering and encourages the latent topics to correlate with
semantically meaningful properties. Multiple evaluations demonstrate that our

While in the resonator, the phase grating transfers intensity from the direct

coupling to the feedline and limits the detection bandwidth to on the order of
1MHz. When operated in KID mode, the detectors are AC biased with tones at
their resonant frequencies of 45.85 and 91.81MHz. In the low-bias, standard KID
mode, a single photon produces a hot spot that does not turn an entire section
of the line normal but only increases the kinetic inductance. In the high-bias,
critical KID mode, a photon event turns a section of the line normal and the

with two currents (sense and bias) entering through the top arms of the ""Y"",
intersecting, and then exiting through the bottom leg of the ""Y""'. This
geometry--mixing two inputs at a sharp intersection point--takes its
inspiration from Y-shaped combiners in fluid flow systems, where variations in
the input pressures can produce at turbulence and mixing at the intersection.
When current is added to or removed from one of the arms (the sense arm), the
superconducting critical current in the other arm (the bias arm) is modulated.
The current in the sense arm can thus be determined by measuring the critical
current of the bias arm. The dependence of the bias critical current on the
sense current is possible because current crowding causes the sense current to
interact locally with the bias arm. Measurement of the critical current in the
bias arm does not break the superconducting state of the sense arm or of the
bottom leg, and thus the signal to be sensed is fully restored after the

Following a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible
with electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic
resolution interaction-free electron microscope, or ""quantum electron
microscope"". A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique
components not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These
components include a coherent electron-beam splitter or two-state-coupler, and
a resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen
multiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free
detection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which
are based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a
grating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential.
Challenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future
directions for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to
build an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified
a number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further
theoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete
interpretation of the images produced by such a microscope."

of two rod-like coiled-coil proteins, cortexillin and tropomyosin, around
patterned gold nanostructures. The high aspect ratio of the coiled coils made
it possible to study their orientations and to pursue a strategy of protein
orientation via two-point attachment. The proteins were anchored to the

was varied to test how this variation affected the structure and arrangement of
the surface-attached proteins. Molecular dynamics studies were used to
interpret the observed positional distributions. Based on initial studies of
protein attachment to gold post structures, two 31-nm-long tropomyosin

central role in processing and transmitting small-amplitude electrical signals.
However, Josephson-junction-based devices have a number of limitations
including: (1) sensitivity to magnetic fields, (2) limited gain, (3) inability
to drive large impedances, and (4) difficulty in controlling the junction
critical current (which depends sensitively on sub-Angstrom-scale thickness
variation of the tunneling barrier). Here we present a nanowire-based
superconducting electronic device, which we call the nanocryotron (nTron), that
does not rely on Josephson junctions and can be patterned from a single thin
film of superconducting material with conventional electron-beam lithography.
The nTron is a 3-terminal, T-shaped planar device with a gain of ~20 that is
capable of driving impedances of more than 100 k{\Omega}, and operates in
typical ambient magnetic fields at temperatures of 4.2K. The device uses a
localized, Joule-heated hotspot formed in the gate to modulate current flow in
a perpendicular superconducting channel. We have characterized the nTron,
matched it to a theoretical framework, and applied it both as a digital logic

nanowire single-photon detectors pulses. The nTron has immediate applications
in classical and quantum communications, photon sensing and astronomy, and its
performance characteristics make it compatible with existing superconducting

current crowding, which occurs whenever the current rounds a sharp turn, tends
to reduce the critical current, but we also show that when the radius of

from the amplitude dependence of the system response. The resulting
``spectroscopy diamonds'' contain interference patterns and population

optimal control models that involve a nonnegative cost function and an affine
mapping in their dynamic programming equation. They include as special cases
classical models such as stochastic undiscounted nonnegative cost problems,
stochastic multiplicative cost problems, and risk-sensitive problems with
exponential cost. We focus on the case where the state space is finite and the
control space has some compactness properties. We assume that the affine
mapping has a semicontractive character, whereby for some policies it is a
contraction, while for others it is not. In one line of analysis, we impose
assumptions that guarantee that the latter policies cannot be optimal. Under
these assumptions, we prove strong results that resemble those for discounted
Markovian decision problems, such as the uniqueness of solution of Bellman's
equation, and the validity of forms of value and policy iteration. In the
absence of these assumptions, the results are weaker and unusual in character:
the optimal cost function need not be a solution of Bellman's equation, and an
optimal policy may not be found by value or policy iteration. Instead the
optimal cost function over just the contractive policies solves Bellman's
equation, and can be computed by a variety of algorithms."

iteration converges whenever it is initialized with a function that is above
the optimal cost function and yet bounded by a multiple of the optimal cost

(robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with
the distance between a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by
the network. Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are
more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an
adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks,
the ""blind-spot attack"", where the input images reside in ""blind-spots"" (low
density regions) of the empirical distribution of training data but is still on
the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can
be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most
importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold
(CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training
makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of

such as biclustering when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the
planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is

Machines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in
dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature
extraction and deep learning.
The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of
learning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables:
ferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot.
In particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence
maximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn
a description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random
Field. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were
developed to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends
straighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.
Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with
constant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse
parity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising
characterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the

in the hope that atomic (or sub-atomic) local interactions would stabilize the
state for a sufficiently long time, thereby allowing later recovery. In this
work we initiate the study of information retention in locally-interacting
systems. The evolution in time of the interacting particles is modeled via the
stochastic Ising model (SIM). The initial spin configuration $X_0$ serves as
the user-controlled input. The output configuration $X_t$ is produced by
running $t$ steps of the Glauber chain. Our main goal is to evaluate the
information capacity $I_n(t)\triangleq\max_{p_{X_0}}I(X_0;X_t)$ when the time
$t$ scales with the size of the system $n$. For the zero-temperature SIM on the
two-dimensional $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ grid and free boundary conditions, it
is easy to show that $I_n(t) = \Theta(n)$ for $t=O(n)$. In addition, we show
that on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ bits can be stored for infinite time in striped
configurations. The $\sqrt{n}$ achievability is optimal when $t\to\infty$ and
$n$ is fixed.
One of the main results of this work is an achievability scheme that stores
more than $\sqrt{n}$ bits (in orders of magnitude) for superlinear (in $n$)
times. The analysis of the scheme decomposes the system into $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
independent Z-channels whose crossover probability is found via the (recently
rigorously established) Lifshitz law of phase boundary movement. We also
provide results for the positive but small temperature regime. We show that an
initial configuration drawn according to the Gibbs measure cannot retain more

field distributions (like Curie-Weiss, Erdős-Rényi) and structured Gibbs
distributions (like Ising model on sparse graphs and Exponential Random
Graphs). Our goal is to test without knowing the parameter values of the
underlying models: only the \emph{structure} of dependencies is known. We
develop a new approach that applies to both the Ising and Exponential Random
Graph settings based on a general and natural statistical test. The test can
distinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain threshold in
the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the threshold
no test can distinguish the hypotheses.
The thresholds do not correspond to the presence of long-range order in the
models. By aggregating information at a global scale, our test works even at
very high temperatures.
The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration
of quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to
Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless
without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this
restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under
consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent
setting; this makes it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein's

parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical
models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $\Omega
(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree
$d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by
Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime
required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly
improved without restricting the class of models.
Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree,
hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume
that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on
ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known
low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction
strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our
second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models

problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative
filtering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each
of $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a
given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of
liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a
key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an
item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same
user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to
users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\log(km)$
initial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm
achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has
an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration
steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the
other to explore similarity between users (novel to this work)."

necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold
at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests
on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there

a Markov chain that sequentially updates individual nodes (variables) in a
graphical model and it is frequently used to sample from the stationary

Glauber dynamics is a natural dynamical model in a variety of settings. This
work deviates from the standard formulation of graphical model learning in the
literature, where one assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution.
Much of the research on graphical model learning has been directed towards
finding algorithms with low computational cost. As the main result of this

computational feasibility of this statistical task. Our main result shows that
parameter estimation is in general intractable: no algorithm can learn the

Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short

assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a
sequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the
minimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number
provides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\em any} assembly

reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the
read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA
sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of
the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise

establish that the prior is not too informative, particularly when the
particular form of the prior is chosen for mathematical convenience rather than
because of a considered subjective belief.
We derive local sensitivity measures for a truncated variational Bayes (VB)
approximation and approximate nonlinear dependence of a VB optimum on prior
parameters using a local Taylor series approximation. Using a stick-breaking
representation of a Dirichlet process, we consider perturbations both to the
scalar concentration parameter and to the functional form of the stick-
breaking distribution.
Unlike previous work on local Bayesian sensitivity for BNP, we pay special
attention to the ability of our sensitivity measures to extrapolate to
different priors, rather than treating the sensitivity as a measure of
robustness per se. Extrapolation motivates the use of multiplicative
perturbations to the functional form of the prior for VB. Additionally, we
linearly approximate only the computationally intensive part of inference --
the optimization of the global parameters -- and retain the nonlinearity of
easily computed quantities as functions of the global parameters.

different conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our

Bayesian robustness are still lacking.
Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate that powerful measures of robustness
can be easily calculated from Variational Bayes (VB) approximate posteriors. We
begin with local robustness, which measures the effect of infinitesimal changes
to the prior on a posterior mean of interest. In particular, we show that the
influence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed
form expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness
measures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one

instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all
possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an
algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively
improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the
base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate
posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of
common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture
multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes."

belong to multiple groups and may have different levels of belonging in each
group. Often the data are also exchangeable, i.e., their joint distribution is
invariant to reordering. In clustering---a special case of trait
allocation---exchangeability implies the existence of both a de Finetti
representation and an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF),
distributional representations useful for computational and theoretical
purposes. In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and
exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along
with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous
feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture
single-occurrence ""dust"" groups. We further introduce a novel constrained
version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between
the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait
allocations. As an application of our general theory, we characterize the

Tamara Broderick,arXiv:1605.06423,https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06423,"Abstract:  The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive
because of the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and prior
specification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are
computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large
datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has
focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a
random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is
often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a
coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this
small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without
modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction
algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for
fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative
models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of
the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional
effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic
and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is
independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset
takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it."

networks and biological networks, and there is growing interest in both
developing models for networks as well as studying the properties of such data.
Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size, it is necessary to
develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of
networks. One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree
distribution. However, other types of power laws that have been observed
empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature
allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data.
In this paper, we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of
interest for modeling graph data, including sparsity and several types of power
laws. We outline a general framework for graph generative models using
completely random measures; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox
(2015), we consider instantiating more of the existing atoms of the random
measure as the dataset size increases rather than adding new atoms to the
measure. We see that these two models can be complementary; they respectively
yield interpretations as (1) time passing among existing members of a network
and (2) new individuals joining a network. We detail a particular instance of
this framework and show simulated results that suggest this model exhibits some
desirable asymptotic power-law behavior."

Tamara Broderick,arXiv:1512.02578,https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02578,"Abstract:  In Bayesian analysis, the posterior follows from the data and a choice of a
prior and a likelihood. One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable
variation in the choice of prior and likelihood, since this choice is made by
the modeler and is necessarily somewhat subjective. Despite the fundamental
importance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, the tools of
robust Bayes are not commonly used in practice. This is in large part due to
the difficulty of calculating robustness measures from MCMC draws. Although
methods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack
generality and often require additional coding or computation.
In contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable
to robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect
to a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior
or likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem,
its methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior
quantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In
the present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field
variational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular
factorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation. We start
by outlining existing local prior measures of robustness. Next, we use these
results to derive closed-form measures of the sensitivity of mean-field
variational posterior approximation to prior specification. We demonstrate our

luminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. We search for
and identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to a
spurious detection. These include systematic shear that leads to a slight
spurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (due
to contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens source
pairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. We develop methods that allow us to
remove these contaminants to the signal. We split the analysis into blue

about 0.002 or better, which is a challenging but feasible requirement for a
low-resolution spectrograph. However, we find that accurate redshifts for z<0.1
supernovae, obtained with ground-based experiments, are sufficient to immunize
the results against even relatively large redshift errors at high z. For the
future cluster number-count surveys such as the South Pole Telescope, Planck or
DUET, we find that the purely statistical error in photometric redshift is less
important, and that the irreducible, systematic bias in redshift drives the
requirements. The redshift bias will have to be kept below 0.001-0.005 per
redshift bin (which is determined by the filter set), depending on the sky
coverage and details of the definition of the minimal mass of the survey.
Furthermore, we find that X-ray surveys have a more stringent required redshift

the explosive increase in perovskite solar cell efficiencies. The same
optoelectronic properties that make perovskites ideal absorber materials in
solar cells are also beneficial in other light-harvesting applications and make
them prime candidates as triplet sensitizers in upconversion via
triplet-triplet annihilation in rubrene. In this contribution, we take
advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite
thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible
spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of
heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite
thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic
heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional
tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal
sensitizers. Our bilayer device exhibits an upconversion efficiency in excess
of 3% under 785 nm illumination."

Shockley-Queisser theoretical limit. In metal halide perovskite solar cells,
the achievable performance gains from photon recycling remain uncertain due to
high variability in perovskite material quality and the non-radiative
recombination rate ($k_{1}$). In this work, we study state-of-the-art

photon recycling and device performance. Importantly, we predict the impact of
photon recycling at the maximum power point (MPP), demonstrating an absolute
PCE increase of up to 2.0% in the radiative limit, primarily due to a 77 mV
increase in $V_{MPP}$. Even with finite non-radiative recombination, benefits
from photon recycling can be achieved when non-radiative lifetimes and external
LED electroluminescence efficiencies measured at open-circuit,

Vladimir Bulovic,arXiv:1803.01192,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01192,"Abstract:  Halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for inexpensive,
high-performance optoelectronics. Despite a remarkable defect tolerance
compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show
substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence
efficiency and device performance. This behavior has been attributed to spatial
fluctuations in the population of sub-bandgap electronic states that act as
trap-mediated non-radiative recombination sites. However, the origin of the
variations, trap states and extent of the defect tolerance remains a topic of
debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of
defect management strategies. By combining scanning X-ray diffraction beamlines
at two different synchrotrons with high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy, we reveal levels of heterogeneity on the ten-micrometer scale
(super-grains) and even ten-nanometer scale (sub-grain domains). We find that
local strain is associated with enhanced defect concentrations, and
correlations between the local structure and time-resolved photoluminescence
reveal that these strain-related defects are the cause of non-radiative
recombination. We reveal a direct connection between defect concentrations and
non-radiative losses, as well as complex heterogeneity across multiple length
scales, shedding new light on the presence and influence of structural defects

the electronic structure of nanostructured solids. Earlier studies of quasi-DC
electric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the
electrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric
fields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In
contrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with
high-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few
picoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD
luminescence even in the absence of an external charge source. Our experiments
show that QD luminescence is associated with a remarkably high and rapid
modulation of the QD band-gap, which is changing by more than 0.5 eV
(corresponding to 25% of the unperturbed bandgap energy) within the picosecond
timeframe of THz field profile. We show that these colossal energy shifts can
be consistently explained by the quantum confined Stark effect. Our work
demonstrates a route to extreme modulation of material properties without
configurational changes in material sets or geometries. Additionally, we expect

simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and
subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting

By ""harden"" we mean that certain error-checking if-conditionals in a given
program P are replaced by equivalent"" we mean that adversaries cannot use
semi-automatic program analysis techniques to reason about the hardened program
paths and thus cannot discover as-yet-unknown errors along those paths, except
perhaps through black-box dictionary attacks or random testing (which we can
never prevent).
Other than these unpreventable attack methods, we can make program analysis
aimed at error-finding ""provably hard"" for a resource-bounded attacker, in the
same sense that cryptographic schemes are hard to break. Unlike
security-through-obscurity, in Cryptographic Path Hardening we use
provably-secure crypto devices to hide errors and our mathematical arguments of
security are the same as the standard ones used in cryptography.
One application of Cryptographic Path Hardening is that software patches or
filters often reveal enough information to an attacker that they can be used to
construct error-revealing inputs to exploit an unpatched version of the

the quantum circuit $\hat{U}$ that encodes its description. In the quest to
better approximate time-evolution $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ with error $\epsilon$, we
motivate a systematic approach to understanding and exploiting structure, in a
setting where Hamiltonians are encoded as measurement operators of unitary
circuits $\hat{U}$ for generalized measurement. This allows us to define a
\emph{uniform spectral amplification} problem on this framework for expanding
the spectrum of encoded Hamiltonian with exponentially small distortion. We
present general solutions to uniform spectral amplification in a hierarchy
where factoring $\hat{U}$ into $n=1,2,3$ unitary oracles represents increasing
structural knowledge of the encoding. Combined with structural knowledge of the
Hamiltonian, specializing these results allow us simulate time-evolution by
$d$-sparse Hamiltonians using $\mathcal{O}\left(t(d \|\hat
H\|_{\text{max}}\|\hat H\|_{1})^{1/2}\log{(t\|\hat{H}\|/\epsilon)}\right)$
queries, where $\|\hat H\|\le \|\hat H\|_1\le d\|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}$. Up to
logarithmic factors, this is a polynomial improvement upon prior art using

$\mathcal{O}(t^{3/2}(d \|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}\|\hat H\|_{1}\|\hat

evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ at time $t$ with error $\epsilon$. We show
that this can be done with query complexity
$\mathcal{O}\big(t+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log\log{(1/\epsilon)}}\big)$ to
$\hat{G},\hat{U}$ that is optimal, not just in asymptotic limits, but for all

required in total, together with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional single and

important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are $d$-sparse or a linear
combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space
complexity, as well as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also
motivates useful new instances, such as where $\langle G|\hat{U}|G\rangle$ is a

faster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the
fraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the
algorithm. Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search
algorithm with the fixed-point property. Meanwhile, it is known that an
adiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian,
can reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. We ask, can an

answer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model,
there are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search,
only some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. Guided by geometric
intuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an

N-representable 2-particle reduced density matrices arise from a unique
N-particle pre-image, satisfying a conjecture established in 1972. We present

Isaac Chuang,arXiv:1003.1774,https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1774,"Abstract:  The tensor product representation of quantum states leads to a promising
variational approach to study quantum phase and quantum phase transitions,
especially topological ordered phases which are impossible to handle with
conventional methods due to their long range entanglement. However, an
important issue arises when we use tensor product states (TPS) as variational
states to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian: can arbitrary variations in
the tensors that represent ground state of a Hamiltonian be induced by local
perturbations to the Hamiltonian? Starting from a tensor product state which is
the exact ground state of a Hamiltonian with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order,
we show that, surprisingly, not all variations of the tensors correspond to the
variation of the ground state caused by local perturbations of the Hamiltonian.
Even in the absence of any symmetry requirement of the perturbed Hamiltonian,
one necessary condition for the variations of the tensors to be physical is
that they respect certain $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We support this claim by
calculating explicitly the change in topological entanglement entropy with
different variations in the tensors. This finding will provide important
guidance to numerical variational study of topological phase and phase
transitions. It is also a crucial step in using TPS to study universal
properties of a quantum phase and its topological order."

a complete understanding of its capacity is very important for the practical
implementation of optimal fault-tolerant architectures. It is known that
stabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily
implemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so
called $\mathcal{C}_k$ hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature
\textbf{402}, 390). Moreover, a subset of $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates, called
semi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture
than the traditional teleportation setup (Phys. Rev. \textbf{A62}, 052316).
However, the precise set of gates in $\mathcal{C}_k$ remains unknown, even for
a fixed number of qubits $n$, which prevents us from knowing exactly what
teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of
$\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation
at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another
one. We show that for $n=1,2$, all the $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates are semi-Clifford,
which is also true for $\{n=3,k=3\}$. However, this is no longer true for
$\{n>2,k>3\}$. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we
introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many
teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate. We
calculate upper bounds for teleportation depth by decomposing gates into both
semi-Clifford $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates and those $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates beyond
semi-Clifford operations, and compare their efficiency."

program, we apply a bespoke program transformation Indexify to convert
expressions that current SMT solvers do not, in general, handle, such as
constraints on strings, into equisatisfiable expressions that they do handle.
To this end, Indexify replaces operators in hard-to-handle expressions with
homomorphic versions that behave the same on a finite subset of the domain of
the original operator, and return bottom denoting unknown outside of that
subset. By focusing on what literals and expressions are most useful for
analysing a given program, Indexify constructs a small, finite theory that
extends the power of a solver on the expressions a target program builds.
Indexify's bespoke nature necessarily means that its evaluation must be
experimental, resting on a demonstration of its effectiveness in practice. We
have developed Indexif}, a tool for Indexify. We demonstrate its utility and
effectiveness by applying it to two real world benchmarks --- string
expressions in coreutils and floats in fdlibm53. Indexify reduces

olivines, directly evidenced by a coincident temporary disappearance of the
tail. The flareup likely reflects a disintegration event, which we suggest was
triggered by intense thermal stress established within the nucleus interior.

David Clark,arXiv:1506.03482,https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03482,"Abstract:  A common and natural intuition among software testers is that test cases need
to differ if a software system is to be tested properly and its quality
ensured. Consequently, much research has gone into formulating distance
measures for how test cases, their inputs and/or their outputs differ. However,
common to these proposals is that they are data type specific and/or calculate
the diversity only between pairs of test inputs, traces or outputs.
We propose a new metric to measure the diversity of sets of tests: the test
set diameter (TSDm). It extends our earlier, pairwise test diversity metrics
based on recent advances in information theory regarding the calculation of the
normalized compression distance (NCD) for multisets. An advantage is that TSDm
can be applied regardless of data type and on any test-related information, not
only the test inputs. A downside is the increased computational time compared
to competing approaches.
Our experiments on four different systems show that the test set diameter can
help select test sets with higher structural and fault coverage than random
selection even when only applied to test inputs. This can enable early test
design and selection, prior to even having a software system to test, and
complement other types of test automation and analysis. We argue that this

better understand software quality and provides practical ways to increase it."

measurements of the projectile. The most commonly-used variant, with an Al
alloy case, was predicted to produce a slightly curved projectile, subjected to
some shock heating, and likely exhibiting some porosity from tensile damage.
The flatness can be improved by using a case of lower shock impedance, such as
polymethyl methacrylate. High-impedance cases, including Al alloys but with
denser materials improving the launching efficiency, can be used if designed
according to the physics of oblique shock reflection. The tensile stress
induced in the projectile depends on the relative thickness of the explosive,
expansion gap, and projectile. The thinner the projectile with respect to the
explosive, the smaller the tensile stress. If the explosive is initiated with a
plane wave lens, the tensile stress is lower than for initiation with multiple
detonators over a plane. The previous plane wave lens designs did however
induce a tensile stress close to the spall strength of the projectile. The
tensile stress can be reduced by changes in the component thicknesses.
Experiments to verify the operation of explosively-launched projectiles should
attempt to measure porosity induced in the projectile: arrival time
measurements may be insensitive to porous regions caused by damaged or
recollected material."
David Clark,arXiv:math/0701339,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0701339,"Abstract:  We describe a modification of Khovanov homology (math.QA/9908171), in the
spirit of Bar-Natan (math.GT/0410495), which makes the theory properly
functorial with respect to link cobordisms.
This requires introducing `disorientations' in the category of smoothings and
abstract cobordisms between them used in Bar-Natan's definition.
Disorientations have `seams' separating oppositely oriented regions, coming
with a preferred normal direction. The seams satisfy certain relations (just as
the underlying cobordisms satisfy relations such as the neck cutting relation).
We construct explicit chain maps for the various Reidemeister moves, then
prove that the compositions of chain maps associated to each side of each of
Carter and Saito's movie moves (MR1238875, MR1445361) always agree. These
calculations are greatly simplified by following arguments due to Bar-Natan and
Khovanov, which ensure that the two compositions must agree, up to a sign. We
set up this argument in our context by proving a result about duality in
Khovanov homology, generalising previous results about mirror images of knots
to a `local' result about tangles. Along the way, we reproduce Jacobsson's sign
table (math.GT/0206303) for the original `unoriented theory', with a few
disagreements."
David Clark,arXiv:cs/9901011,https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9901011,"Abstract:  The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer
set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet
is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information
dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between
individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.
In this paper, several of us involved in the development and evolution of the
Internet share our views of its origins and history. This is intended to be a
brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. This history revolves around
four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with
early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies),
and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the
infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher
level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global
and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which
resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and
evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in
an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed
and available information infrastructure."
